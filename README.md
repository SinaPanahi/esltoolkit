# ESL Toolkit - English as a Second Language Learning Website

## Project Overview

The ESL Toolkit, previously hosted at esltoolkit.com, was a comprehensive website designed to help learners of English as a second language improve their language skills. The website featured a wide range of educational games and activities focused on enhancing English proficiency. Key technologies used in this project include PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, and MariaDB for data storage.

## Project Details

### Objective

The primary objective of the ESL Toolkit was to provide an engaging and interactive platform for ESL learners to practice and enhance their English language skills. The website aimed to make learning English enjoyable through a variety of educational games and activities.

### Features

- **Game Categories**: The website offered several game categories, including memory games, sentence formation games, reading games, and more. Each category contained up to 70 distinct games, catering to different language learning aspects.

- **Dynamic Templating**: Vanilla PHP was used to implement dynamic templating, allowing the website to assemble pages and content at runtime. This made it easy to manage and organize the extensive collection of games and activities.

### Technologies Used

- **PHP**: The server-side scripting language used to build the website and handle dynamic content generation.

- **JavaScript & jQuery**: Used to create interactive and responsive elements, including game interfaces and user interactions.

- **MariaDB**: A relational database management system used for storing user data, game scores, and other relevant information.

### Project Status

The ESL Toolkit was once a live website and served as a valuable resource for ESL learners. However, please note that the website is no longer live and accessible.
